### About
I build production-grade WhatsApp-API SaaS with Fastify + Baileys, MySQL 8, and real-time WS/REST.
On the frontend, I ship clean, responsive UIs with Tailwind, Arabic/English i18n, and RTL/LTR support.

- Secure tokens (HMAC), rate-limit, CSP/helmet
- Multi-tenant device/session architecture with QR lifecycle
- Clear API docs, examples, and pricing/quotas model

### Featured Project — Wsla WhatsApp SaaS
- Baileys-based session manager (safeStop, reconnect, conflict handling)
- Devices/messages/groups endpoints; real-time events; QR cache
- MySQL schemas for devices, device_settings, usage, webhooks
- Dashboard UI with QR view, i18n (AR/EN), and polished UX

### Tech
React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Fastify, WebSocket, Baileys, MySQL 8, Cloudflare, Docker (basic), SEO basics.
